[![Loopia API](https://static.loopia.se/loopiaweb/images/logos/loopia-api-logo.png)](https://www.loopia.se/api/)


This package implements the [libdns interfaces](https://github.com/libdns/libdns) for Loopia, allowing you to manage DNS records.

## Usage
```golang
import (
    loopia "github.com/libdns/loopia"
)
p := &loopia.Provider{
    Username: "youruser@loopiaapi",
    Password: "yourpassword",
}

zone := "example.org"
records, err := p.GetRecords(ctx, zone)
```
For more details check the `_examples` folder in the source.

## Noteworthy
If you are adding or chainging records, like acme/letsencrypt validation, Loopia is somewhat slow to propagate the result.
It might take __up to 15 minutes__. That said, I have seen it come throug in as little as 1,5 minutes.

To do everything this library can do the Loopia API user needs access to the following...

- getSubdomains
- addSubdomain
- removeSubdomain
- getZoneRecords
- addZoneRecord
- updateZoneRecord
- removeZoneRecord
